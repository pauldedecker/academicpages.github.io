My partnership with the Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association was made possible through an Undergraduate Summer Student Internship Program grant to my student, Laura Tulk (BA, Linguistics 2020), and a subsequent Quick Start Grant from the Office of Public Engagement.

That initial collaboration has grown into a solidarity research project (Yarbrough, 2020) that now includes > 20 members of various stakeholder organizations such as the Newfoundland and Labrador Association of Speech Language Pathologists and Audiologists, Eastern School District, Eastern Health, Department of Education, Canadian Mental Health Association of NL, the Disability Policy Office, Coalition of Persons with Disabilities NL, and the Association of Early Childhood Educators NL.

Access to Services

We are currently designing online surveys and community-based events to better understand the experiences People Who Stutter face in accessing limited stuttering treatment and mental health services in the province.

Sociolinguistics of Stuttering: Project #1 Concealable Stimgatized Identity

We anticipate interviewing ​40 PWS (20 CWS and 20 OAWS) and collecting experiences via the online survey from more PWS. ​PWS participants in this project will be invited to help direct the research process by providing insights on issues and questions they feel we should investigate.

Our solidarity partnership leverages assistance from Eastern Health who will provide a consultative role to help with access to health literature, reviewing and analyzing literature, assisting with the development of surveys, and serving as another lens to help contextualize the data or reports. They have already provided a model for Community Engaged Research events and activities based on Bishop et al. 2020 that we intend to implement for this project. Note that we are not requesting funds from ARC-NL to set up and conduct community events as other sources will be utilized.

The Canadian Mental Health Association, Newfoundland & Labrador (CMHA-NL) also support this project. Through this research endeavour, policy and practice can be influenced by evidence-based decision making. CMHA-NL supports research in our province by and for marginalized populations which supports advocacy and system change. CMHA-NL will bring a mental health lens and focus to the research, contributing further value to this study.
