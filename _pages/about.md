I am a sociolinguist and my research includes SSHRC-funded, qualitative and quantitative studies of linguistic variation and language change in varieties of English spoken in Newfoundland and Labrador, including differences across region and time. My interest in sociolinguistic practice (i.e. patterns of language behaviour, attitudes, and ideologies) that emerge with non-standard and stigmatized speech styles led me to partner with the Newfoundland and Labrador Stuttering Association (NLSA) and investigate the sociolinguistics of stuttering and speech disfluency.

The first stage of our project used a survey methodology to examine the perception of and attitudes towards stuttering which yielded the short documentary, “Getting the Words Out”. This video was distributed widely online and nominated in 2020 for the Silver Wave Film Festival’s Best Student Documentary.

I am the lead researcher and author of “The DOCTalks Guide: Cross-sector Collaborative Practices for Knowledge-based Documentary Media” the bilingual French/English, Canada Media Fund-funded resource for producing collaborative documentary media for the purposes of knowledge-exchange and implementation.

I am committed to community-scholarly engagement, working with non-academic partners, and conducting research with Newfoundlanders and Labradorians.
